# C++ Chess Game with AI

## Overview
This project is a **Chess Game implemented entirely in C++**. It allows users to **play chess against an AI opponent** in the console, with **all standard chess rules** enforced.

The system is designed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, making the code **modular, maintainable, and easy to extend**.

---

## Features
- Play chess with all types of pieces: King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, and Pawn
- Human vs AI gameplay mode
- AI opponent uses **algorithmic decision-making** to determine optimal moves
- Console-based board display with ASCII representation
- Validates moves according to chess rules, including check, checkmate, and stalemate
- Optional: save and load game state

---

## Requirements
- **C++ Implementation**: Entirely written in C++
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Uses classes like `Board`, `Piece`, `Player`, `AI`, `Game`, etc.
- **Clean Code Practices**:  
  - Meaningful variable and function names  
  - Proper input validation and error handling  
  - Well-documented methods and classes  

---

## Gameplay
- Players input moves using **algebraic notation**, e.g., `e2 e4`.
- AI calculates moves based on **algorithmic evaluation of the board**.
- Game ends when **checkmate**, **stalemate**, or **draw** occurs.
