# C++ 3D Maze Generator & Solver

## Overview
This project is a **3D Maze Generator and Solver implemented entirely in C++**. It allows users to **generate complex 3D mazes and automatically find solutions** for them.

The system is designed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, making the code **modular, maintainable, and easy to extend**.

---

## Features
- Generate **3D mazes** with customizable dimensions
- Supports different **maze generation algorithms** for varied complexity
- Automatically **solves the maze** and finds the shortest path
- Displays maze structure and solution in **console-based visualization**
- Provides **step-by-step solving** for better understanding
- Implements **algorithmic techniques** for maze generation and solving

---

## Requirements
- **C++ Implementation**: Entirely written in C++
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Uses classes like `Maze`, `Cell`, `Generator`, `Solver`, etc.
- **Clean Code Practices**:  
  - Meaningful variable and function names  
  - Proper input validation and error handling  
  - Well-documented methods and classes  

---

## Functionality
- Users can define the size of the 3D maze (length, width, height)
- Maze generator creates a random solvable maze
- Solver finds the **shortest path from start to finish**
- Displays maze layout and solution clearly in the console
- Can handle large mazes efficiently using **algorithmic approaches**

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/3DMaze_Generator_Solver.git
cd 3DMaze_Generator_Solver
