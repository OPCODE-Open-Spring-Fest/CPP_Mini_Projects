# C++ Mini Database Engine

## Overview
This project is a **Mini Database Engine implemented entirely in C++**. It allows users to **store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently** using a simplified database system.

The system is designed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, making the code **modular, maintainable, and easy to extend**. It also **supports file handling** to persist data between sessions.

---

## Features
- Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on data records
- Supports multiple tables with defined schemas
- Query data using simple commands
- Ensures **data consistency and integrity**
- **File handling** to save and load database state from files
- Implements **algorithmic techniques** for indexing, searching, and organizing data efficiently

---

## Requirements
- **C++ Implementation**: Entirely written in C++
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Uses classes like `Database`, `Table`, `Record`, `QueryProcessor`, etc.
- **File Handling**: Uses file streams to persist data across sessions (`fstream`, `ifstream`, `ofstream`)
- **Clean Code Practices**:  
  - Meaningful variable and function names  
  - Proper input validation and error handling  
  - Well-documented methods and classes  

---

## Functionality
- Users can create tables with defined columns and data types
- Supports insertion, deletion, and updating of records
- Query and filter data with simple search operations
- Efficient data management using **algorithmic structures** internally
- **Save and load database** using file handling, ensuring data persists across runs
- Can handle multiple tables and multiple records per table
