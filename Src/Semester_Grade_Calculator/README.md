# C++ Semester Grade Calculator

## Overview
This project is a **Semester Grade Calculator implemented entirely in C++**. It allows users to **calculate semester grades and GPA** based on marks obtained in different subjects.

The system is designed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, making the code **modular, maintainable, and easy to extend**.

---

## Features
- Input marks for multiple subjects
- Calculate **percentage, grade, and GPA** automatically
- Supports **different grading scales** (e.g., A-F, 4.0 GPA, 10-point scale)
- Console-based display of results
- Validates input to ensure **marks are within acceptable ranges**
- Can generate **summary of all subjects** with grades and GPA
- Implements **algorithmic calculations** for grades and GPA

---

## Requirements
- **C++ Implementation**: Entirely written in C++
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Uses classes like `Semester`, `Subject`, `Calculator`, etc.
- **Clean Code Practices**:  
  - Meaningful variable and function names  
  - Proper input validation and error handling  
  - Well-documented methods and classes  

---

## Functionality
- Users can enter:
  - Number of subjects
  - Marks obtained in each subject
  - Credit hours for each subject (optional)
- The program computes:
  - Percentage for each subject
  - Grade based on chosen grading scale
  - Semester GPA based on credits and grades
- Ensures calculations are **accurate and consistent** across all inputs
